###############################################################################################################################

Since version 3.8.9, change log moved to: http://www.amcharts.com/javascript-maps/changelog/

#### 3.8.8 ####################################################################################################################

   # two finger zoom with touch devices fixed.

#### 3.8.7 ####################################################################################################################

   # link to amCharts.com site in a free version was made less noticable - it uses chart's font color and font size and you
     can adjust it's position using creditsPosition property of AmChart. Possible values are: top-left, top-right, bottom-right
     and bottom-left. This will help you to achieve better layout of a chart.

#### 3.8.6 ####################################################################################################################

   # Bug fix - charts with legend could fail if there was a google analytics script in the page.

#### 3.8.5 ####################################################################################################################

   # Old listeners are removed automatically if the same listener was added, this helps to avoid duplicate calls of event
     handlers

#### 3.8.4 ####################################################################################################################

   # some improvements for export as image script were made.

#### 3.8.3 ####################################################################################################################

   # hideBalloonTime property added to AmChart class, default value is 150 (milliseconds). It sets time after which balloon is
     hidden if user rolls-out of the object. Increasing the time might help to prevent balloon flickering while moving the
     mouse over the object.

#### 3.8.2 ####################################################################################################################

     skipping this version to match the version of amCharts.

#### 3.8.1 ####################################################################################################################

   # You can now set theme for all the charts on your page by setting:
     AmCharts.theme = AmCharts.themes.light;  // or some other theme
     If you are creating charts using JavaScript API, not JSON, then this is quite a comfortable way, as you won't need to
     pass theme to each object you create.

   # bug fix: rendered event was fired only on first render, now it is fired each time the chart is rendered after
     chart.validateNow(); method is called. This bug caused the export buttons to dissapear after the validateNow() method.


#### 3.8.0 ####################################################################################################################

   # Since this version amMaps support themes. This means that instead of seting every property for each object, you can set
     new defaults in a theme file. This will make devs' life a lot easier.

     Currently you can find three themes in ammap/themes folder - dark.js, light.js and chalk.js To set a theme for a map,
     simply set theme property to the name of the file: theme:"light". Note, this will work only if you are creating map
     using JSON config. If you do it in old way (JSON config is supported since v 3.7.0), you should pass theme object for
     each new object you build, for example: var smallMap = new AmCharts.SmallMap(AmCharts.themes.light);

     We will be adding more themes soon. Check _usingThemes.html file in samples folder to see themes in action.

#### 3.7.0 ####################################################################################################################


   # AmCharts.makeChart(divID, chartConfig); method added. divID is id of a div where your chart should appear. chartConfig is
     JSON object with chart or map configuration. Check examples with _JSON_ prefix in samples folder to see this in action.

   # type property added to AmChart class. It is required to specify type to one of the following, when creating charts from
     JSON config: serial, xy, radar, pie, gauge, funnel, map, stock

   # a possibility to export charts as image/pdf/svg added for all modern browsers except IE9 (IE10 is supported). The
     exporting doesn't require any server side software and is made using js libraries only. Check samples with
     _exporting_ prefix to see this in action. Exporting to SVG doesn't work very properly with stock chart or charts with
     legend (will offer saving multiple files).

   # Color picking for maps with values adjusted.


#### 3.6.1 ####################################################################################################################

   # FireFox error messages about style declarations fixed

   # Bug fix: maxWidth property of AmBalloon was ignored

   # Some other minor bugs fixed

   # draging of a map on touch devices fixed

#### 3.6.0 ####################################################################################################################

     Great new features added - map now support patterns - areas can be filled with images. Check our new inspiring samples at
     http://www.amcharts.com/inspiration/ to see new possibilities in action.

   # patterns
     Patterns can be set for areas via pattern property of MapArea. Value of pattern should be object with url, width, height
     of an image, optionally it might have x, y, randomX and randomY values. For example:

     graph.pattern = {"url":"../amcharts/patterns/black/pattern1.png", "width":4, "height":4};

     check ammap/patterns folder for some patterns. You can create your own patterns and use them.

     Check mapWithPatterns.html example to see this in action.

   # hand-drawn style
     if you set map.handDrawn = true, lines used in a map will be distorted and will produce hand-drawn effect.
     You can also modify map.handDrawScatter (default value is 2) and map.handDrawThickness (default value 1) values for
     more scattered view.

   # offsetY and offsetX properties added to AmBalloon. Specifies the distance from the mouse position to balloon's pointer.
     You might want to increase distance when using hand drawn style.

   # Some minor problems fixed

#### 3.5.0 ####################################################################################################################

We jumped to 3.5.0 version to mark a version which must use amCharts V.3 instead of V.2 (if you use them together).
This new version added a lot of new cool features to the balloon:

    # Balloons can now display any HTML and CSS inside them. This means you can add images, format text or display just about
      any HTML/CSS content. Because of this new feature, we removed textShadow property of AmBalloon in this version.
      Example: areaStacked.html, barStacked.html and many other.


    # Balloon now can animate from point to point and also fade out when user moves away from the chart. animationDuration and
      fadeOutDuration properties added to AmBalloon, with default values 0.3. animationDuration property was also added to
      ChartCursor, so that the cursor line would also animate to its position.
      Example: any chart with balloon.


    # Balloon now can display shadow. shadowColor (default #000000) and shadowAlpha (default 0.4) added to AmBalloon.
      Example: any chart with balloon.


    # Some default values of AmBalloon changed for a better usability - adjustBorderColor to true, cornerRadius to 0,
      pointerWidth to 6, color to #000000.
      Example: any chart with balloon.

These values are used when choosing a color for an area.

AmMap now supports negative values.

getDevInfo() method added to AmMap. Returns object with a lot of information about the coordinate where the
mouse currently is:
{type:"writeDevInfo", chart:AmMap, zoomLevel:zoomLevel, zoomX:zoomX, zoomY:zoomY, zoomLatitude:zoomLatitude,
zoomLongitude:zoomLongitude, latitude:latitude, longitude:longitude, left:left, top:top, right:right,

percentBottom:percentBottom, str:string}

i.e. US-AK. Please note that this is different from the codes we used previously which used underscores.
Map files for consistency were also renamed to correspond to the map entity names,
i.e. usaLow.js and AmCharts.maps.usaLow.
